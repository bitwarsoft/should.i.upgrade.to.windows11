The new Microsoft operating system is here in Windows 11. There are a lot of great enhancements such as a fresh look, new multitasking functions, a few performance upgrades, and a Microsoft Teams upgrade. 

When considering the upgrade for you or your whole company, you want to make sure you have made an informed choice. Before you download and install, letâ€™s take a look at what the windows 11 update has to offer. 

## What you need to know about Windows 11 ?

Windows 11 is the latest big iteration of Microsoft Windows. Microsoft started releasing Windows 11 for consumers on October 5, 2021, after spending a few months in beta. The release version was missing a few features, like native Android emulation, which Microsoft added in February 2022, although only for US users. Additionally, the release version is having a staggered rollout, which means it may take a while for your eligible systems to get the update.

Windows 11 is a free upgrade, but the minimum system requirements are quite a bit higher than ever before. Microsoft calls Windows 11 the most secure Windows yet, and that tag comes at the cost of backward compatibility. Trusted Platform Module 2.0, aka TPM 2.0, is one of those requirements. There are ways to manually install Windows 11 on incompatible systems, but those include giving up on official future updates via Windows Update and/or modifying the Windows 11 ISO file to remove security checks.

## Major Reasons to Upgrade to Windows 11 Now

1. A More Consistent Interface
2. Improved Included Apps
3. A Better Screenshot Tool
4. Snap Layouts for an Organized Desktop
5. Widgets for Quick Access to News, Weather, and More
6. Twice as Resistant to Malware
7. Improved Multiple Desktops and Monitor Docking
8. Run Android Apps on Your PC
9. Gaming Performance and HDR Improvements

## What is new about the Windows 11 update?

Right off the bat, the most noticeable upgrade is the visual refresh. The new design is the biggest visual change we have seen in a Microsoft operating system update so far. The six pre-existing theme options are, in our opinion, beautifully designed and have personalizable dark and light features to go with them.

Another big change is that the taskbar is no longer left-aligned, but centered, similar to Apple products and other competitors. Also, a redesigned Start menu offers more functionality without a drastic change. 

Many of us are heavy multitaskers and rely on having many windows open during our workdays. With this new update, you can now have multiple virtual desktops, similar to Macs, that you can swipe between. Snapping multiple windows into place is even easier as well.
